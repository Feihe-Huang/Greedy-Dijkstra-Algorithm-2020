# Greedy-Dijkstra-Algorithm-2020
Course work to finish Greedy-Dijkstra-Algorithm in 2020. (first year in university)

###Greedy Walk:

Modules:\
route_utility module: define functions to put the data into a 2D list and
output the results\
greedy_route module: define another function to get the route\
Last: use the functions to get the result.


Functions:


get_elevation_diff(): get the elevation difference between two vertices
get_elevation(): put the data into a 2D list
get_greedy_route(): record the route
output_file(): output the routes into a file
output_best(): output the optimal route into a file


###Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm:


Modules:\
dijkstra_route module: define a function to get the shortest route.\
route_utility module: define functions to put the data into a 2D list and output
the results \
Last: use the functions to get the result.


Functions:\
get_route(): get the shortest path between two vertices\
get_routes(): output route from a dictionary to a list\
get_elevation(): put data to a 2D list\
get_elevation_diff(): get the elevation difference\
get_vertex_str(): put the data of a vertex into the right format of (x, y)\
get_vertex_str_x() and get_vertex_str_y() put x, y value into that format\
get_path_tuple(): put data into tuples which can be used in get_route()\
output_file(): output all routes into a file\
output_best(): output the optimal route into a file\
